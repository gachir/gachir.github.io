        <h2>Welcome to the orchard weed website</h2><br>
        <p>The aim of this site is to collect and share information on insects and organisms observed on weeds.</p>
        <p>At the moment, the vast majority of observations are not shared or only shared within a small group.</p>
        <p>If we could develop a resource that is continually updated, an incredible resource could be developed.</p>
        <p>Researchers, primary industry officers and entomologists could also use this imformation to help determine and guide their work.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>At this stage, it would be fantastic if you could send photos and descriptions of what you are seeing. 
            It doesn't matter if you don't know what type of weed or insect you are observing, just take a picture. 
           <br> Please include:
